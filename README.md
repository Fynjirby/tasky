## Install

#### Fastest way 
Run this command in terminal and it will install everything itself
```sh
curl -L https://sh.fynjirby.dev/tasky | sh
```
or if you prefer GoLang package manager use
```sh
go install github.com/fynjirby/tasky@latest
```
#### Manual way
Go to [releases](https://github.com/Fynjirby/tasky/releases/) and download latest binary for your OS, then move it to `/usr/local/bin/` and enjoy with simple `tasky` in terminal!

## Building
- Install [Go](https://go.dev/) and make sure it's working with `go version`
- Clone repo
- Run `go build` in repo directory, then move it to `/usr/local/bin/`

## How does it work?

When you run `tasky add "text"`, tasky automatically creates tasky.json file in the current directory and all future work will be with that file until you change the current directory.

When you archive a task using `tasky archive "text"`, it moves the task to a separate file called `taskyarchive.json`. If the task is already archived, the same command will unarchive it and move it back to the main task list.

When you remove task it just removes from tasky.json, so you like just drop it

### Why tasky.json in current dir?

That is the best way for working in teams on any projects. You can just add tasky.json to git repo and it will sync all across your team's computers!

## Usage

`tasky`

-   `add "text"` to add a new task with "text"
-   `rem "text"` or `rm` or even `delete` to remove a task with "text" (terminal regular expressions are allowed - `*` and `?` for now)
-   `list` or `ls` to see tasks list
-   `archive "text"` to archive a task with "text" (or unarchive it if already archived)
-   `archive` to see the list of archived tasks
-   `help` or `man` to see help message
